# Data Structures (Arrays, Lists, Maps)
Data structures are fundamental for organizing and managing collections of data efficiently. In Java,
commonly used data structures include arrays, lists (such as ArrayList), and maps (such as HashMap).

# Arrays:
    - Arrays are fixed-size data structures that store elements of the same data type.
    - They have a contiguous memory allocation and a predefined length, which cannot be changed once the array is created.
    - Arrays use index-based access to retrieve or modify elements, and they offer faster access times since elements are stored sequentially in memory.

# Lists (ArrayList):
    - Lists are dynamic-size data structures that can store elements of different data types. ArrayList is a commonly used implementation.
    - 

# Maps (HashMap):
    - Maps are key-value pairs that allow efficient retrieval ofvalues based on keys. HashMap is a widely used implementation:
    - Unlike arrays and lists, HashMaps don't preserve the insertion order of elements.
    - HashMaps do not allow duplicate keys but permit null values and at most one null key.
