# 1. Primitive Data Types
- These are the fundamental building blocks for storing simple values.These data types are directly supported by the language and are not objects.


# Here are the main primitive data types in Java:
int: Represents integers.

double: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
  
float: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
  
char: Represents a single Unicode character.
  
boolean: Represents a boolean value, either true or false.
  
byte, short, long: Represent integers of different sizes.

These primitive data types are memory-efficient and are used to store simple values efficiently compared to objects
  
# 2. Operators and Expressions
Operators in Java are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Expressions, on the other hand, are combinations of variables,
values, and operators that result in a single value. Understanding operators and expressions is fundamental for performing calculations and manipulating data in Java.

# Below are various types of operators in Java
### Arithmetic Operators:
    + (addition)
    - (subtraction)
    * (multiplication)
    / (division)
    % (modulo)

### Relational Operators:
    = = (equal to)
    != (not equal to)
    > (greater than)
    < (less than)
    > = (greater than or equal to)
    < = (less than or equal to)
### Logical Operators:
    && (logical AND)
    || (logical OR)
    ! (logical NOT)

### Assignment Operators:
    = (assignment)
    + =,-=,*=,/= (compound assignment)

### Increment and Decrement Operators:
    + + (increment)
    â€” (decrement)
